        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>My primary goal as a musician has always been to make music accessible to as many people as possible. I would like to combine my classical music training with an Interactive Media graduate degree to broaden artistic expression by integrating musical elements into a compelling experience for a wider audience.</p>

  <p> I am interested in changing the classical music performance scene by creating a media interface that would allow the audience to interact with the orchestra. The result would be a collaborative performance between professional musicians and their audience. This area of study, using intelligent visual stimuli in addition to traditional audio stimuli, has the potential to change music performance as well as music education.</p>

   <p>My explorations in this area as an undergraduate have included the visualization of rhythm, chord qualities, and musical phrasing. Initially, my inspiration for these projects came from personal experience while practicing flute and later from information obtained in my psychology coursework. As a visual learner, I use imagery to achieve particular tone colors and characters of music. Psychology has taught me about how the brain mainly acts as a processor of images. With both of these inspirations in mind, I would like to create a music performance setting in which the audience can join in on the music making process by experiencing the visual stimuli that fuels musical expression of the individual and of the entire ensemble.</p>

  <p>Beyond combining interactivity with music performance, I am interested in exploring other ways to use interactive media to promote music access and education. For student musicians, I imagine mobile apps that assist in the efficiency and productivity of individual practice sessions. I also have plans for an app that helps the practicing musician assess and find solutions to problems they seem to be having involving instrument fundamentals such as tone, scales, and articulation. For toddlers and young kids, music education can start at an early age involving more musically intelligent and responsive children’s toys. I also have ideas involving web media that allows users to interact with orchestras of the past and present using an interactive, virtual history.</p>

  <p>I chose the University of Miami for my undergraduate studies because of its strong music program within a university setting. This allowed me to receive excellent music training while also taking additional coursework in my other areas of interest, specifically psychology and communication. I strongly believe that my experience as an Instrumental Performance major at the Frost School of Music with minors in Psychology and Interactive Media provides an excellent fit with UM’s Interactive Media MFA program. My long term personal and professional goals revolve around three concepts: creativity, technology, and human interaction. I believe that my undergraduate coursework reflects this, and I wish to pursue the combination of these three areas in the MFA program.</p>
